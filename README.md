The name makes no sense? Of course it doesn't, it is just a random string of words I threw together. Silly you, thinking there are logic here.

## TODO (Tasks)

Things to work on, though nothing is in any particular order ('Cause chaos and madness are more fun).

### Config/Deploy

* Set up a CI/CD pipeline (pipeline... not pipe) (using Jenkins or some other free equivalent)
* Implement HTTPS with port 443 (currently just running on http - okay since I don't take user input (gets hacked next week))
* Switch Angular to Production Mode
* Ensure AoT Compilation in Angular for Efficiency
* Create A Deploy Strategy for Uploading Content

### Back-end

* Ensure effective error handling
* Clean up the damn code. It is getting smelly AF back here!

### Front-end (General)

* Abstract and clean up the CSS for components. At the moment there is a lot of duplication
* Ensure scalability down to mobile
* Create Favicon to server up

#### Photography

* Card Grid
* Enlarge Selection
* Need to make Photo delivery more performant

#### Coding

* Create examples to be run in live View
* Figure out how to feed code other than the reusable shared components
* How to run that code (package dah bich?)
* Add Syntax hilighting for pretty

#### Writing

* Add a area to write out descriptions/author notes for the writing page
* Add "favorite" button

## Future Features

Nothing - everything - because we aren't even at 1.0.0 yet!!!!

### Unimportant stuff

* Create simple non-persistent chat (socket.io)
* Add loading bar when querying against the backend or loading a new page of the app
* Consider using discord as a means of communication
* Create a mailing list


# Real Time

* Find time to actually write while doing all of this coding (hah)
