The name makes no sense? Of course it doesn't, it is just a random string of words I threw together. Silly you, thinking there are logic here.

## TODO (Tasks)

Things to work on, though nothing is in any particular order.
### Config/Deploy

* Set up a CI/CD pipeline (using Jenkins or some other free equivalent)
* Implement HTTPS with port 443 (currently just running on http - okay since I don't take user input)
* Create a new Deploy server from scratch and deploy to that

### Back-end

* Ensure effective error handling

### Front-end

* Add a area to write out descriptions/author notes for the writing page
* Toggle the TOC depending on whether it is going to be used or not
* Abstract and clean up the CSS for components. At the moment there is a lot of duplication
* Add an Icon set and utilize Icons in the application
* Ensure scalability down to mobile

#### Photography

* Card Grid
* Enlarge Selection
* Carosol Scroll

#### Coding

* Live View
* Code View
* Select View

## Future Features

Nothing - everything - because we aren't even at 1.0.0 yet!!!!

### Unimportant stuff

* Create simple non-persistent chat (socket.io)
* Add loading bar when querying against the backend or loading a new page of the app
