# Personal Website

The name makes no sense? Of course it doesn't, it is just a random string of words I threw together. Silly you, thinking there are logic here.

## TODO (Tasks)

* Need to fetch a list of available files from the backend.
... Probably need to create a map for simplicities sake, rather than sending complex strings to the backend for the action.
* Need to figure out how to parse out titles and Section headers for the TOC
* Need to add a description area to the TextViewer Component
... Might be nice for it to be toggleable. We'll see. Got to keep that page clutter down
* Need to creat a Card View textViewer, would be nice for simple poetry and the likes
* Simple Chat feature for home page - non-persistent
* A how-do-yah-do for the home page as well. Got to explain what the site is.
* Need to figure out how to keep the front-end routing from not fetching on inital load.

## Future Features

Nothing, because we aren't even at 1.0.0 yet!!!!
