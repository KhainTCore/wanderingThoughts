# Personal Website

The name makes no sense? Of course it doesn't, it is just a random string of words I threw together. Silly you, thinking there are logic here.

## TODO (Tasks)

* Create coherent custom themes for the site
    
    make more complex and comprehensive themse
* Description area for textViewer/Writing Page
* Abstract and clean up the CSS for components, it's all over the place right now
* Import Home Page bio/info from a README instead of nesting in the HTML

## Future Features

Nothing, because we aren't even at 1.0.0 yet!!!!

### Unimportant stuff

* Create simple non-persistent chat (socket.io)
* CardView to completement TextView but for simpler and smaller things
