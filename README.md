# Personal Website

The name makes no sense? Of course it doesn't, it is just a random string of words I threw together. Silly you, thinking there was logic here.

## TODO (Tasks)

Things to work on, though nothing is in any particular order ('Cause chaos and madness are more fun!).

### Config/Deploy

* Set up a CI/CD pipeline (pipeline... not pipe) (using Jenkins or some other free equivalent)
* Implement HTTPS with port 443 (currently just running on http - okay since I don't take user input (gets hacked next week))
* Ensure AoT Compilation in Angular for Efficiency
* Create A Deploy Strategy for Uploading Content (Do it the best way - manually, muwahaha)

### Back-end

* Clean up the damn code. It is getting smelly AF back here!

### Front-end (General)

* Abstract and clean up the CSS for components. At the moment there is a lot of duplication
* Ensure scalability down to mobile
* Create Favicon to server up
* Hide console.logs if in Dev mode (on HTTP Errors)

#### Photography

* Need to make Photo delivery more performant
* Identify panaramas and either stretch for them or flag so the user can easily tell
* Add subtitles? Jokes perhaps?
* Add entrance animations (Gave up at the moment, as I prefer not being angry every five seconds)

#### Coding

* Create examples to be run in live View
* Figure out how to feed code other than the reusable shared components
* How to run that code (package dah bich?)

#### Writing

Blissfully empty (don't burst my bubble, damn it)

* (Bubble popped, sadness) Ensure a Natural sort for the contents of each catagory

## Future Features

Nothing - everything - because we aren't even at 1.0.0 yet!!!!

### Unimportant stuff

* Create simple non-persistent chat (socket.io)
* Add loading bar when querying against the backend or loading a new page of the app
* Consider using discord as a means of communication
* Create a mailing list


# Real Time

* Find time to actually write while doing all of this coding (hah)
