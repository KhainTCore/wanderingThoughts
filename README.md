# Personal Website

The name makes no sense? Of course it doesn't, it is just a random string of words I threw together. Silly you, thinking there are logic here.

## TODO (Tasks)

* Abstract Button Menu into its own Feature Component/Module
* Use it to also create a style shifter for textViewer
* Create coherent custom themes for the site
* Hide TOC when there are no major breakpoints in the currently viewed document
* Clean up and finish the site footer 
    
    Unfixed, but will appear static on pages like writing
* Description area for textViewer/Writing Page
* Abstract and clean up the CSS for components, it's all over the place right now
* Link to Tree's dA page/insta
* Import Home Page bio/info from a README instead of nesting in the HTML

## Future Features

Nothing, because we aren't even at 1.0.0 yet!!!!

### Unimportant stuff

* Create simple non-persistent chat (socket.io)
* CardView to completement TextView but for simpler and smaller things
